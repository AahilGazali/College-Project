# Quick Start - PDF Extraction System

## âœ… System is Ready!

Your PDF extraction system is **fully configured** and will automatically extract all data from uploaded PDFs and store it in MongoDB.

## How It Works

### 1. Faculty Uploads PDF
- Frontend: `UploadDocuments.js` component
- User selects PDF file and enters details (title, subject, type)
- File uploads to server

### 2. Automatic Extraction (Background)
```
Upload â†’ Server receives PDF â†’ Background extraction starts
```

### 3. Data Saved to MongoDB
All extracted data is stored in the `documents` collection:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `extractedText` | ALL text content from PDF |
| `metadata.pageCount` | Number of pages |
| `metadata.wordCount` | Total word count |
| `metadata.extraction_method` | How it was extracted |
| `topics` | Auto-extracted key topics |
| `processingStatus` | Status of processing |

### 4. Ready for Use
- Search documents by content
- Generate AI questions from text
- Analyze document topics
- Build question papers

## What Gets Extracted

### From the PDF:
- âœ… All text content
- âœ… Page count
- âœ… Word count
- âœ… Key topics (top 10)

### Methods Used:
1. **pdf-parse** - Fast, for text-based PDFs
2. **tesseract.js** - OCR for scanned PDFs  
3. **python-worker** - Advanced OCR with preprocessing

## Testing

### Upload a PDF and verify:
```javascript
// After upload, check MongoDB:
db.documents.findOne({ title: "Your PDF Title" })

// You should see:
{
  processingStatus: "completed",
  extractedText: "... all PDF text ...",
  metadata: {
    pageCount: 15,
    wordCount: 3247,
    extraction_method: "python-worker"
  },
  topics: [...]
}
```

## Files Involved

1. **Upload Endpoint**: `server/routes/documents.js`
   - Line 88-97: Triggers background extraction
   - Line 92: `pdfService.processDocumentExtraction(doc._id)`

2. **Extraction Service**: `server/services/pdfService.js`
   - Lines 22-200: Complete extraction pipeline
   - Lines 179-193: Saves data to MongoDB

3. **Database Model**: `server/models/Document.js`
   - Lines 62-97: Schema for all fields
   - Lines 127-149: Topics extraction method

4. **Python Worker**: `server/services/pdf_extractor/pdf_processor.py`
   - Advanced OCR fallback with pre-processing

## No Action Required!

The system is **fully automated**. When faculty uploads a PDF:
1. âœ… Document saved
2. âœ… Background extraction starts
3. âœ… All data extracted
4. âœ… Saved to MongoDB
5. âœ… Status updated to "completed"

## Monitoring

Check server logs for extraction status:
```
âœ… Extraction completed for document 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011
```

Or query the database:
```javascript
const docs = await Document.find({ 
  processingStatus: 'processing' 
});
```

## Next Steps

Your extraction system is ready! Faculty can now:
1. Upload PDFs (syllabus, PYQs, references)
2. Wait for automatic extraction (2-60 seconds)
3. Use the extracted text for:
   - AI question generation
   - Document search
   - Content analysis

**Everything is connected and working!** ðŸŽ‰
